# For CPLEX

Place here the folder /ibm that is installed by CPLEX (usually in /opt).
You actually only need the following substructure:
.
└───ibm
    └───ILOG
        └───CPLEX_Studio1281
            └───cplex
                ├───bin
                ├───include
                ├───lib
                └───matlab

Alternatively, you can install cplex anywhere else in your computer and add cplex to the 
path or provide the path to cplex when running the "setting.m" file
